                In August 2010 couple of concerned Punjabis started Punjabi
                Radio USA with the idea of being a radio station “of the people,
                by the people, and for the people.” After acquiring Radio Geet
                Sangeet and 12 stations throughout California, Nevada (Reno) and
                State of Washington (Seattle) Punjabi Radio USA has
                distinguished itself as the largest Punjabi radio station in the
                world with its coverage area. Based in San Jose, California,
                Punjabi Radio USA now broadcasts 24/7, 7 days a week all the way
                from Bakersfield, California up to Reno, Nevada and State of
                Washington covering the following areas as well: Tracy,
                Livermore, Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento, Yuba City, Fresno, all
                of the S an Francisco Bay Area, Reno and Seattle area.
